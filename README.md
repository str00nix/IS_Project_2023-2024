Integrated Systems Project
==========================

This is a project for FCSE for the subject Integrated Systems.

The project consists of two .NET Applications:
- An MVC Application which was built using the Onion Architecture, which
  enables a User to browse music tracks and create playlists
- An MVC Admin Application with which the admin can communicate with the
  Music Application through a RESTful API Service. This application enables
  more functionality, as well as importing and exporting music to and from a csv file.

We have created two functional application using the Onion Architecture, following
best practices, and have Integrated both of them.

We have learned a lot from this project and completed all the tasks assigned to us.
